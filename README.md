Permutations:
what is 240th permutation of 6
what is 3240th permutation of 7

output:
1 5 4 3 2 0
4 2 6 5 3 1 0

combinations:
input:
24th combination of 3 out of 8
112th combination of 4 out of 9

output
1 2 5
3 4 5 6

Note:
For this challenge I copied an algorithm on Permutations and Combinations respectively. It is probably against the spirit of the Challenge, but my desire to not re-implement the same mathy algorithms I spent years in school learning is the same reason I picked Daily Challagnes over Project Euler.

I had more interest in sorting the list itself. I had a much more in-depth investigation of sorting sequences of lists. I initially tried to dynamically create a sorting comparison function for the sequences, but many type exceptions later I ended up just hard coding Tuples for sorting.
